            <h3>My background</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey. I moved to Ridgewood when I was 10 years old. I'm a freshman in Bergen
                County Technical Schools in Teterboro, in the computer science program </p>
            <p>I've been passionate about computers since I was young. The event that really sparked my interest in
                computer science was in seventh grade when I heard of BCTS, and I researched the CompSci program. After
                doing so, I sought out technology.</p>
