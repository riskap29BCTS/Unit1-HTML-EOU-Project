        <h2>My Interests & Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of my major, I am also interested in many things that make me a balanced. Here's a couple of things that I enjoy.</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>I enjoy many games, but I enjoy story indie games the most. I really want to work on high-quality, affordable games for the masses that entertained me in my childhood</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <h4>My Favorite Games</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Hollow Knight: Silksong - I love the art style, theme of worthiness, and the dynamic gameplay</li>
                <li>Deltarune - It stresses the importance of friendships in life, and how not making them limits your pathway</li>
                <li>Undertale - The ultimate storytelling game. It puts an interesting awareness in my actions </li>
                <li>Hades - The idea of being bound by your elders' reputation is quite relatable.</li>
                <li>Shovel Knight - It's a great game, and it's story is a bit silly, but the game itself has a really fun movement style</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Why I like indie games</h4>
            <p>I like indie games because they promote a message. For example, game series like Mario or Sonic have become money grabs. Companies see their success and use the brand to make money, rather than look at video games as a form of art. Indie games are more raw, and use their unique concepts as a selling point.</p>

            <h3>Board Games</h3>
            <img src="images/arcs.webp" alt="a photograph of my favorite board game" width="500">
            <h4>My Origins in Board Games</h4>
            <p>I've enjoyed board games since I was a child. My father played games like WoW and D&D when I was a child.I looked at the synergies and thought he put into these games, and I wanted to play games as complex as he did. Video games didn't provide the same feeling as board games because the many inputs on a controller or a keyboard adds too much grey area to be a game of complete strategy. </p>
